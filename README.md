# Whale_Sound_Classifier
Whale Sound Classifier is a web based sound classifier that classifies whales on the asis of the audio files that are uploaded by the users. The Classifier is built using random forest classifier with some parameter hypertuning and is as of now works for classifying 3 whales - Northen Right Whales, False Killer Whales and Killer Whales. The project is deployed using a flask server.

After uploading the audio the audio waves are sampled and using Machine Learning the whales are being predicted. Here is one of the examples:

# Future Scope
This Whale Sound Classifier can be extended for other sea animals and for other species of whales. 
This project can also be used as a sound classifier for voice recognations. Its only the database on which the model is trained and sampled. 

# Industrial Uses
The industrial aspect of this classifier are:
1. This can be helpful in research base for the whales.
2. The model with some twicks can be used for a voice recognation system.
